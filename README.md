# 🚗 Vehicle Rental System (Java)

The **Vehicle Rental System** is a Java-based application designed to manage the process of renting vehicles such as cars, bikes, and scooters. It allows users to browse available vehicles, check prices, book rentals, and return vehicles. Admins can manage vehicle inventory, customer details, bookings, and rental history.

This project showcases strong use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts including inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation, interfaces, exception handling, and file/database storage.
