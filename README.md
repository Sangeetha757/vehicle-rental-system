# 🚗 Vehicle Rental System (Java)

The **Vehicle Rental System** is a Java-based console application designed to manage the process of renting vehicles such as cars, bikes, and scooters. The system allows customers to browse available vehicles, view rental costs, book a vehicle, and return it. Admin users can manage vehicle inventory, customer details, and view all rental records.

This project demonstrates strong use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation, interfaces, exception handling, and optional file/database storage.
